# Chicago at the crossroads

### This riveting historical peek at 1919 Chicago does little to paint a picture we can recognize but does a masterful job of showing how the City of Chicago that we do recognize almost didn't happen.

Put mildly, the summer of 1919 was the wrong time to find yourself in Chicago and 'City of Scoundrels' illustrates just how bad things can get when the people with power are motivated by all the wrong things.

Like a political continuation of 'Sin in the Second City', 'Scoundrels' climaxes with the avoidable bloodshed of the 1919 race riots but while City Hall and Springfield may have been puppeteers, the citizens of Chicago are largely accountable for the incidents that played out in rapid succession as the temperature peaked in July 1919.

The crash of the Wingfoot, a passenger blimp that would make its final voyage over the Loop financial district, marked the beginning of what would be the worst summer in Chicago history. It's said that the Wingfoot was the first tragic accident to be reported around the nation as it happened. The blimp and its flames were in full view of reporters covering the White Sox-Yankees game at Comiskey(sp) Park. Telegraph messages to New York were received before emergency crews were on the scene downtown.

While a blimp crash was a tragedy, the rash of bombings along the South Side were terrorizing. While the FBI started investigating the incidents as part of a communist labor movement, the real motive behind the bombings were directly associated to gentrification. In short, African-Americans were moving to Chicago in record numbers and they needed a place to live. White landlords saw an opportunity to make money with the properties they owned and rented to the black migrants. As more migrants showed up, the landlords simply packed more people in their buildings.

This problem had occured before. Pilsen was full of immigrants from the Czech Republic, Wicker Park was a Polish enclave. But you wouldn't see a Czech move into a Polish neighborhood. Now you had African-Americans moving into traditional Irish, Polish and German neighborhoods. While the Troubles in Northern Ireland happened some 50 years later, we know what happens when Irish people don't share the same religion... and now you want them to mix with another race?

So the bombings terrorized wide swaths of


Racial tension in the black belt of the city just south of the loop receives the lions share of attention, and it should. A weeklong riot that left 38 dead would grab national headlines even today. But it is how the city handled it on every level that boggles the mind.

With local police overwhelmed, Governor (name) saw the opportunity to bolster his national stature for a Presidential run and sent in the National Guard. Meanwhile, Mayor William 'Big Bill' Thompson wanted to do anything he could to sabotage the presidential aspirations of Gov. (name).

The political tug-o-war would see a battalion(sp) of National Guard ordered to wait for orders in a local armory while the streets were full of roving gangs, rape, robbery and gunfire.

Somehow, the 1919 race riots didn't end the political careers of all involved - including Richard Daley, who was a member of one of many athletic clubs that caused much of the chaos as the riots played out.

The battles would reach their peak at the Republican National Convention at the Chicago Colliseum, where Big Bill would finally land the fatal blow to his rival when rumor spread that Gov. (name) had been buying delegates from the St. Louis region. Whether or not it was true didn't matter. The newspapers hit the convention floor just as the event recessed for the evening. The next day, it was all over for Gov. (name).
