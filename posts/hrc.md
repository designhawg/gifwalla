# HRC, Clinton at State

### An in-depth look behind the curtain into Hillary Clinton's tenure at State offers at least one perspective

Anytime you see a political title show up in the months before the election cycle warm up, you can guess that you're either diving into a puff piece or a witch hunt.

HRC did a good job of not feeling overtly pro-Hillary, drawing direct attention to incidents that could be considered embarrassing to her tenure at State. The mislabeled restart button with Russia, the historical irony of Clinton comforting close aid Huma (last name spelling) through the sexting scandals involving Huma's husband - Anthony Weiner and the information implosion surrounding the handling of the assault on the US diplomatic compound in Bengazi (sp).

Throughout the book, Clinton is painted as loyal to a fault. It's the reason many believe she lost the election in 2008 and the reason she was able to be a staunch supporter of President Obama's initatives (sp) while guiding State through a time of relative calm.

I did come away from HRC agreeing with that author regarding the calm around Clinton's time at State being greatest achievement of her tenure. Diplomacy is centered on finding peaceful resolution to conflicts around the world. I don't recall any Ukraine incidents on her watch.

So was Clinton that good or is Kerry that bad? The more accurate question might be to ask if successful tenure in diplomatic positions is more a reflection of timing than a measurement of ability?

That said, even amid the quiet Clinton was performing small miracles that went largely unnoticed by Americans.

Going back into campaign mode, she used her pull in the business community to raise private funds for a pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo. The leadership in China made it known to western companies that they felt insulted when the US decided to not participate in the event. To Shanghai, this was the equivilant of boycoting the Olympics. Clinton pulled out an acceptable, if imperfect, representation for the US in very little time. The Chinese felt respected and American companies benefitted.

With Obama focused on pivoting attention to build better relationships with the countries in SE Asia, the plight of Burma - specifically women - became a key initiative. Burma had been under heavy influence of China for years and their heavy-handed approach to dealing with political rivals reflected that. Clinton's respectful yet stern approach to Burma brought freedom to political prisoners and reforms to that nation.

Much of the book focuses on the idea of 'Smart Power'. Simply put, 'Smart Power' is the usage of incentive-based sanctions. Not all carrot, but not all stick. Rather than simply imposing sanctions and giving nations little clue of how to work out of them, 'Smart Power' basically gives political powers baby steps to follow to ease them away from their hardline positions. 'Smart Power' bought freedom in Burma, but its not a silver bullet and results vary as we saw near the end of Clinton's tenure in an 11th hour deal to keep Egypt and the PLO from extended fighting with Israel. Here, 'Smart Power' brought people to the table but ultimately just kept hostilities at bay for another day.

The irony of having to broker a peace between Israel and Egypt is that the formerly technologically backward Clinton found her State Department helping spur the Arab Spring movement via the use of technology.

While I probably tweeted something related to Obama's victory in 2008, Clinton's camp simply failed to utilize it or any of the new communication advancements effectively during her campaign. Yet during the Arab Spring of 2010, we see aids in Clinton's State Department that were helping rallying Egyptians via Twitter and Facebook. The move is depicted as a moment where the staff had inadvertantly broken with the official Obama stance on Egypt and they fully expected the wrath of Clinton for their actions. Clinton comes in and firmly supports their actions and wants to see more of it. Hillary wasn't at the technological helm, but she didn't back down from it either.

Nor was Clinton at the helm of the 'Texts from Hillary' meme, but that receives more of the spotlight than it needed-at least from a timing perspective.

In the book, we shift from Clinton at a baby shower where she's just been told that the Libyan dictator Momar Kadafi has been killed. Triumphantly, Clinton is quoted saying 'We went. We won. He died.' (need to double check this) Literally a few pages later, we're yucking it up over a political meme where most of seems to largely focus on female empowerment and penis jokes.

At first, I was more miffed at the play that texts from Hillary received in the book. Only later did I really digest that I wanted less celebration from Clinton regarding Kadafi. According to the book, she would later apologize for the statement but the fact that she made it forces me to see her far more hawkish than I feel is likely accurate.

I understand the need for action but there is no room for celebration when dealing with death. Ever. I want to hold our society to a higher level and I have a hard time seeing humanity ever getting there when our leaders fail to meet that criteria.

This represents maybe 20% of the content of HRC. The professional friendship of Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates was informative and the glimpse into the Clinton political machine (starring Bill Clinton) is beyond entertaining. But the wins are painted as appearing smaller because of the nature of diplomacy and the losses all seem close to Clinton but more attributable to someone else.

So HRC falls firmly in the category of informative and entertaining but slick to the point of leaving a hint of skepticism.
