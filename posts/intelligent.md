# A plan for guessing in the dark

### I've got a joke. Three Harvard Business School alums want to start their own companies.

The punchline? They all struggle and its hard.

If there is anything about The Intelligent Entrepreneur, it is that is pulls back the curtain to display that everyone struggles when starting their own companies - even the people who seem to have the money to enjoy the experience.

The ten rules that author Bill Murphy covers are both obvious and easy to forget when you are in the throws of starting a company.

1) Commit - you can't do this half-heartedly.
2) Find a problem, then solve it - Probably my biggest issue. I have solutions before I accurately identify a worthy problem.
3) Think big, think new, think again - What can you do that hasn't been done before? How big do you need to scale it for you to generate positive cash flow? And finally, is this big idea the smartest way to go about attacking your problem?
4) You can't do it alone - The number of solo founder startups that fail are staggering. You need someone to run support and fight throught the growth with you.
5) You must do it alone - No one is ever going to care about the project more than you. That means you'll get stuck doing the grunt work until things pickup or you move on.
6) Manage risk
7) Learn to lead
8) Learn to sell
9) Persist, persevere, prevail
10) Play the game for life
