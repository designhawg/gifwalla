# One thing

### Reading a book can be an epic journey. After the past couple of years of constant immersion into deeper thought, it feels like time to surface a key insight from the books that have impacted me the most. All titles are presented in alphabetical order. Each title should be seen as equally important.

### 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing
Nothing is harder to change than established behavior.

### 48 Laws of Power
First, just go buy the book. But above all, know that you are playing in the game of Power whether you want to or not. So make yourself aware of the rules, that way you can at least recognize the motives behind the people around you.

### The 80/20 Principle

### The Art of the Start
Go. Make. Meaning. If you attempt to work for yourself, don't waste your time doing anything that that is pointless. If what you are doing is somehow making the world a better place, that fact alone will pull you through the tough times when everyone else would have quit.

### City of Scoundrels
There may never be a summer in Chicago worse than the summer of 1919. The bad politics of Mayor William Thompson would prime Chicago for Al Capone's era of crime and corruption that would follow.

### David and Goliath

### Delivering Happiness

### Design of Everyday Things

### Design is a Job
Let's all be adults and agree that talking about money isn't weird - it's a necessity of life and we'll all do a good job of covering our asses while doing our best work for the people we work with and for. Deal?

### The Devil in the White City

### Drive
To understand the actions of your co-worker, a spouse, you kid, etc... you must first uncover the motivation behind their action.

### Freakonomics
Understanding why something happens often can be distilled down to one thing - incentive. If you can determine the incentive, the reason behind every action will become clear.

### Giving

### Good to Great
Great companies are just good companies that found the ability to focus their energy and cut away anything they did that was mediocre. Walgreens and their old soda fountains some to mind. They cut the dead weight (the soda fountains) even though it was a hard decision and doubled down on what customers valued.

### The Great Gatsby

### How Children Succeed

### How to be Black

### HRC
Your success in some jobs will be measured by how much attention you don't attract. Recognize that and prepare yourself mentally for how to handly such situations.

### Hug Your Customers
Mistakes are only bad when you don't seize the opportunity to turn the situation into an example of how much you care about your customers. While you shouldn't mess up on purpose, you should see it as a great chance to form a lasting bond with the customer if you go above and beyond to make it right.

### In Cold Blood
So did Capote steer the trial and subsequent appeals with his access to the prisoners while writing In Cold Blood or was that just a theatrical embelishment added for the movie 'Capote'? The movie casts In Cold Blood in a slightly different light and it is something I hope to investigate further at a later time.

### The Hunger Games Trilogy

### The Last Firewall
20 years into the future, we've got implants and the user experience still matters. That said, we've got robots that can throw their conciousness from one place to another. How long until we can do that? When will I be able to rent a body and go have lunch in Paris? The idea of being able to branch my conciousness like a git repo is intoxicating and entirely not part of this book. But a good sci-fi book should make you dream and that is exactly what this one did.

### The Lean Startup
All products are flawed and when they fail, we always point to the imperfections, but it is our inability to get over the imperfections of our work is ultimately what will kill our products. So stop building in a vacuum and go interact with potential customers now.

### Lean In
If you are in the room, sit at the table and act like you belong. Listen closely and pay attention so when your time comes, you will be ready to take advantage. You can't do that if you aren't already sitting at the table.

### Lean Publishing
A book is a startup and this isn't such a new idea. The great English authors of the 1800s were very Lean in their serial approach to producing high literature through magazine publication first and books second.

### Lean UX
Design and development start at the same time, with input from all parties and then everyone dives into their specialties - not the other way around.

### Linchpin
The unscalable, creative assets that no process can be put around are the key to winning in the new economy. And when you hear a nagging voice resonating in the back of your mind telling you to play it safe, just realize it's your lizard brain trying to hold you back.

### Made to Stick
There are two steps in making your ideas sticky. 1) Find the core. 2) Translate that core using the SUCCESs checklist (Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credentialed, Emotional, Story).
If you want to make a story stick, find a way to make things concrete and find a way to work on the audience's existing mental models/schemas. And if you really want to get people to care, make them take off their statistical hats so that you can keep yourself out of Mazlo's basement.

### The Now Habit
Procrastination is harder work than the work itself. And if you must work, you might as well get to it so you can enjoy the time you have set aside for other activities that are just as important as the time spent on the job. Unscheduling is your first key to reclaiming your top line productivity.

### The Personal MBA
You are reading the distillation of Josh Kaufman's guide to life. If I could suggest to you any single book off of this list to go read right this instance, The Personal MBA would be it. That's not completely fair to the other fine books on this list, but it is the reason why those other books are on this list.

### Quiet
The most effective leaders are typically introverts. Charisma isn't required to lead.

There is a difference between good presentation skills and good ideas.

She just sited Jim Collins, Good to Great and the story of Darwin Smith from KimberlyClark. "What characteristics make a company outperform its competition?"
Every company was led by a CEO who was "quiet, humble, reserved". Great leaders build their companies, not their personal brands and egos.

Great leaders are more interested in listening and gathering information than asserting their opinion.

Introverts are more likely to hear and then impliment suggestions of proactive team members. Extroverts work best with passive workers who are happy to take orders and act on them. Extroverts need to be more reserved so that people step up in team environments.

There are extroverts and introverts in animals other than humans.

There is no one right personality. The survival of the fittest mentality allows for both because a key ingredient in survival is the environment in which you operate. Extroverts, while highly adaptive, tend to run needlessly into risk. Introverts, will cautiously wait and adapt but have been witnessed starving in the process.

Extroverts win in high school. Introverts win in college.

Persistence is a trait of introverts that is related to their ability to focus.

Free trait agreement... The idea is that you will sometimes act out of character in order to live the rest of your time in your natural character. If success demands you to act out of character but doing so will buy you the freedom to live the rest of your time naturally, then you have a free trait agreement with yourself. You can have these agreements with people, work and the environment around you.

### The Real Purpose of Parenting
Kids are like basketball. You have to understand when they need constant pressure and guidance and when they need to have room to establish themselves. It's similar to playing man-to-man and zone defense. You play a lot of man-to-man with kids younger than 10 and then you gradually give them more and more space as they get older. But don't try to tell them how to play the game or how you would play it. You already have your life, let them have theirs.

### The Reason For God
God has already accepted your imperfections. Isn't it time that you did the same thing.
Related, there isn't a right time to accept God - so just do it already. He loves you regardless of where you are at in life or have been prior to now.

### The Shadow Factory
Information doesn't travel in a straight line and because of the way it bounces around the globe, anyone can likely track anything they want. You're phone calls to a neighbor may bounce at the speed of light to Pakistan and back. An email from your mom may have been routed through China. That is how the system works and that's also how the laws have been bent to allow for such easedropping. You have to understand how the system works to see how the law is actually broken. I'm pretty sure lawmakers simply didn't understand how the system worked, but ignorance shouldn't grant our elected officials a free pass.

### Sin in the Second City

### The Social Animal
Our motivations for learning will change drastically as we age, but it will always be driven by our ability to attain and manipulate mental models. The best way for us to learn is simply to do.

### Switch

### The Tipping Point
The social circle really isn't a circle at all - it's more of a triangle and your strongest connections aren't likely to be the most important ones in the long run.

You don't cultivate connections by staying still or staying at home. Equally, hitting every party won't do you favors either. 12-18 month cycles are the trick. Every 12-18 months, change something. Jobs, gyms, churches - something. Pretty soon, you'll make lasting connections and see your value within the community grow.

Also, when leading people remember to be direct and assign responsibility to a specific person. When an action is required from a group, no one is likely to step forward, which is why it is vital to take the lead and simply assign someone to the task.

### War Lovers
The greatest American product is that art of self-promotion. It doesn't matter how you feel about it - you have to recognize that it is part of the game. Either you play by the rules or accept to be penalized in exchange for keeping a little bit of worthless pride.

### We Are All Weird
Your weird, quirky nature may be your most marketable trait. Embrace your inner weirdness and do everything you can to cultivate it. Society is threatened by it and wants you to conform. Don't do it. Stay weird and be rewarded handsomely.

### Where Good Ideas Come From
Slow evolution is the root cause of most things that appear to be eureka moments. The concept of the 'adjacent possible' stands out as not only a method explaining evolution over time but also in how ideas are percieved by others. In a recent job interview, I was dealing with someone who just couldn't see where I was going with the vision that I was projecting. Had I simply put myself in their shoes, I would have been able to see that their ability to see was directly impacted by their lack of knowledge in the space I was describing. What seemed like a logical leap seemed overwhelming to them. Needless to say, you can't sell what they can't see.

Dreams, chemicals, error and random chance have just as much to do with innovation as diligent effort and study. It is our ability to hold ideas in our mind like a 'commonplace book' for long periods of time that ultimately will prepare us for the moment when eureka occurs. It likely won't happen over night, but the evolution of the idea and your mind will get you there if you stick with it.
