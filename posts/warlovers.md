# The hawks of the past continue to define the present

### 'War Lovers' serves timely reminder of the tender ground all modern nations are built on

'Don't cheer, boys. The poor devils are dying.' â€” Rear Admiral John W. Philip

For all the hawks and doves that populate this well written book, it is Rear Admiral Phillip's quote that sticks with me because it manages to capture the rare moment of grace in the face of victory.

I am beginning to believe that the graceful spirit of people like Phillip's is far more prevelant in our society than it might appear at first glance. But that's only because I am finally acknowledging something I have tried to deny my entire life.

Humanity pulls itself forward largely through rampant self-promotion and gloating, with no one coming close to dominating this field quite like the Yankees.

'War Lovers' tells the story of a post-Civil War America attempting to heal itself while always on he lookout for trouble. The problem with this approach is that you often find trouble when you are looking for it and the whole reason you are looking for it is to distract yourself from the noble act of doing something positive - like fixing yourself.

The Spanish-American War was a pointless exercise, propped up by numerous unprovable arguments and rampant jingoism - not unlike the U.S.-led Iraq invasions or the recent Russian invasion into the Ukraine.

For events like the Spanish-American War to occur, you need a certain cast of characters to be on stage. You need someone who embodies the spirit of fight, which accurately depicts Theodore Roosevelt. Someone who is attempting to display their power to sway opinion is also needed and here William Randolph Hearst and his 'New York Journal' recklessly played their part. You also need a third hand in play that possesses a quite power - an ability to get things done in the background without raising suspicion. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge was the mentor and friend that Roosevelt needed to navigate his way to battle and later to the Presidency. Without Lodge, the Roosevelt name wouldn't be so familiar in the American conciousness as it is today.

Roosevelt, Lodge and Hearst were classic hawks. Ready for war and excitement at any given moment.

The only true dove in their way was Speaker of the House Thomas Bracket Reed. During his time as Speaker, Reed remade the House into a functioning body of government by holding people accountable by upholding procedure and keeping his hands clean. Reed was opposed to the expansionism that was in the air at the time, often pointing to America's own unsolved problems as a reason to not so looking for more lands to conquer.

Reed possesses what we would call common sense.

But his common sense was backed by deep thought, understanding and a desire to keep his politics clean. No special interest money, no slandering your opponent. And that stance is exactly why his run for President in 1896 was cut short. He ran out of money and William McKinley went on to become President and lead America into the war with Spain.

When Reed died, Lodge eulogized that Reed was 'a good hater, who detested shams, humbugs and pretense above all else.'

Without Reed, the course of American history would have been altered early in skirmishes with England over Venezuela - a battle that the fledgeling U.S. Navy would have stood no chance of winning.

But Venezuela became the argument to build a Navy for people like Lodge, Roosevelt and Hearst. You needed a Navy to protect yourselves against the English. And you also needed to protect the nation's interest in other regions - like Hawaii.

Hawaii was still its own kingdom, but American businessmen with sugar crops in Hawaii saw the looming threat of Japan and urged American forces to claim the islands before they were lost to a foreign foe. The Japanese had just purchased two battleships - from the English. It was only a matter of time before this bolstered the argument to build a stonger Pacific fleet that would be used to protect Hawaii and lead the campaign to take the Philippines from the Spanish.

America didn't need a Navy until the spirit of imperialism swept the capital and hawks on the hill seized on the opportunity.

The idea of the American frontier had ended. California had been reached and while there was plenty of land in between to be settled, leaders in Washington were hungry for new adventure. The open sea must have looked like a giant Wild West to Roosevelt as he began positioning for a post in the U.S. Navy. Why else would a East Coaster-turned-ranchhand angle for such a position. And let's not forget that Roosevelt was prone to seasickness.

When Roosevelt wasn't promoting himself for higher office and position, he was fighting against his past. As a child, Teddy Roosevelt's father purchased his way out of enlistment during the Civil War. Roosevelt idolized his father, but saw this as his great mistake. To miss out on 'the glory of war'.

I suspect that the 'glory of war' machismo is as foreign to me as it was to Rear Admiral John W. Philip. If you have to fight, you do your best to survive and you do not celebrate your victories over others. You honor your opponent by fighting as hard as you can and when you are victorious you restain yourself. Your victory has likely cost someone else their life. But it should stretch beyond the battlefield.

But the 'glory of war' is even more out of wack in today's culture. We have so closely aligned our games to make this simulation available to anyone that the pain simply isn't real anymore. As much as I think Roosevelt was twisted when he later would celebrate one of his children being shot in battle, I worry more about the middle school kid playing 'Gears of War' and walking away from it with the overall sensation of 'meh'.

That's not to say that Teddy Roosevelt wasn't a thinking man. There was much strat

Equally, Hearst was quite wreckless with the public trust but he was masterful in his ability to tap into the conciousness of society and pull just the right strings to sway opinion one way or another. What bothers me more about Hearst is that while he held this great power, he was so greedy that he couldn't be bothered to build an empire on that alone. Hearst was always bankrolled by his mother and the silver mines that supported the empire. From his businesses to the wars to the castle later built in San Simeon, it is hard to see Hearst as anything more than a trust fund baby now. Frankly, Citizen Kane painted him in a fairer light than the facts ever could have.
